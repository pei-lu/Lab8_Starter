# Lab 8 - Starter
## check your understanding:
- 1 The test should be in Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, because we want to to shourtten the time we do the test, so test the code each tame we push would save a lot of time. also , tests should be done continuessly during the developping process not all at once by the end.  
- 2 Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? 
No, because this is not what E@E test used for.
- 3 no, because unit test is used to test if a funvtion return the value correctly.but is not able to test the linkage between pages.
- 4 yes, because this function wiuld return an exact answer, and unit test is used to see if the result returned matched 80char.
